This easy star model for X-Plane 10 has been tested thoroughly by Bill Premerlani and Peter Hollands while developing Helical Turns. 

To use the model, you need to copy this directoy to a sub directory of the "Aircraft" directory in your installation of X-Plane 10.

For example, in Macos,  if you are in the top directory of MatrixPilot ...
cp Tools/HILSIM_XPlane/Aircraft/easystar_with_aileron ~/Desktop/X-Plane\ 10/Aircraft/Radio\ Control/ 

That should make a directory under Aircraft/Radio Control/ with your easy_star_with_aileron model, which you can then access from within X-Plane 10 to select.
