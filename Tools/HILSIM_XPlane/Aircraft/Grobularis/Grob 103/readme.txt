Grob 103 (grob103) - solo pilot configuration/front seat
X-Plane ver. 9+

History of this file and updates:

Having logged many, many hours in a Grob 103, I decided to model the sailplane for X-Plane version 5 back in 2001. The original has been revised and perfected in X-Plane version 5.66 and has progressed through versions 6, 7 and into 8. Now, we are at 9! The data for the Eppler 603 airfoil has been used and taken into account, along with much flight-testing from various X-Plane glider pilots over the years. 

This particular release (December 2008) contains yet another complete rework of the fuselage, wings and other surfaces. Also, a new 3-D interior cockpit object (sans pilots, for now) has been added.

Background of the Grob 103:

This is a model of the Grob 103, built in Germany, and currently quite popular as a club and training sailplane in the United States and abroad. It is a gentle ship, and has fairly good performance for a two-place sailplane.

Statistics for the 'real-world' Grob 103 are as follows:
Span 17.5 m./ 57.4 ft 
Aspect ratio 17.2 
Airfoil Eppler E 603 
Empty weight 368 kg. / 811 lb. 
Payload 212kg. / 468 lb. 
Gross weight 580 kg. / 1279 lb. 
Wing loading 32.58 kg./sq. m. / 6.67 lb./sq. ft. 
L/D max. 35:1 at 105 kph /56 kt / 65 mph 
Min. sink 0.75 m/s / 2.45 fps / 1.45 kt at 80 kph / 43 kt / 49 mph 

This model flies fairly close to the official specifications (though very few pilots have recorded an actual 35:1 in the G103) and it is as follows:
L/D max 32:1 at 53 kt
Min. controllable airspeed, level and clean is at 40 kt 

The stall speed in this G103 still hovers around 32 kt, whereas the actual G103 stalls in solo configuration around 41 kt. I have been working to make this model stall more like the actual ship (though it is kinda nice to have stall speeeds so low!), and STILL don't have it quite right. The airspeed indicator reads slightly faulty below 40 kt. You'll be stalling soon around that speed anyway!

Handling the Grob 103:

Ground handling is fairly simple: keep the wings level on tow and steer with the rudder. You might find that you will lift off before the tow plane, which is fine and normal. Just be sure not to baloon up and stay as close to the towplane's altitude.

On tow, you will want to try to keep the towplane on the horizon. This is the 'high tow' position, and is common for aerotows in the U.S. This beta release is a little difficult in that the magnetic compass and panel restricts your view. I am working on the viewpoint, and have settled on one where it is the best average of all situations (ground, tow, cruise, landing). You will want to match the towplanes angle of bank and take care not to zoom to the outside of a turn or turn inside too quickly.

During cruise, you will find the best L/D between 51 and 57 kt. If you are thermalling, you will want to do so at minimum controllable airspeed (corrected for bank angle!)...basically, you will want to execute tight (45 degree) turns at around 55 kt. If you are making lazy turns at a 10 degree bank angle, you will fly in a thermal at around 42 kt. If you find yourself in sinking air, simply put the nose down and build up speed to AT LEAST best L/D (52 kt...probably faster)

Landing is easy. You make the pattern at 60 kt and deploy about 1/2 to full spoilers on downwind. In real life, you would most likely not use as much spoilers, but X-Plane seems to not be as effective. You can also try slipping to land, though this model does not slip as well as a G103 in real life. You will flare out just above the earth (2 feet or so) and hold it off the runway as long as you can without grossly pulling back. You will want to touch down with as little energy as possible!!!

In appreciation:

A great amount of thanks goes back to 2006 and 2007, especially to Yves Cuttat for the airfoil data that I used back in version 6. The advice he provided was invaluable. Big thanks also go out to Austin for taking a look at this model and evaluating its airbrake efficiency against work in development during versions 7 and 8.
